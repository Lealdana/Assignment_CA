          Venezuela, country located at the northern end of South America. It
          occupies a roughly triangular area that is larger than the combined
          areas of France and Germany. Venezuela is bounded by the Caribbean Sea
          and the Atlantic Ocean to the north, Guyana to the east, Brazil to the
          south, and Colombia to the southwest and west. The national capital,
          Caracas, is Venezuela’s primary centre of industry, commerce,
          education, and tourism. Venezuela Venezuela Venezuela administers a
          number of Caribbean islands and archipelagos, among which are
          Margarita Island, La Blanquilla, La Tortuga, Los Roques, and Los
          Monjes. Since the early 19th century Venezuela has claimed
          jurisdiction over Guyanese territory west of the Essequibo River
          totaling some 53,000 square miles (137,000 square km)—nearly
          two-thirds of the land area of Guyana. Venezuela also has had a long
          dispute with Colombia over the delimitation of maritime boundaries in
          the Gulf of Venezuela and around the archipelago of Los Monjes.

        <h2>How diverse is it?</h2>

        <p>
          According to Conservation International, Venezuela is one of 17
          megadiverse countries in the world and the 7th country in the world
          with the highest number of wild species. Megadiverse countries: “house
          the largest indices of biodiversity, including a large number of
          endemic species“. This makes Venezuela one of the greatest countries
          for animal and wildlife lovers. The country is home to around 21,000
          plant species and some 38 per cent of these are endemic to the country
          and over 8,000 endemic animal species. Venezuela is also home to 1,417
          species of bird, 351 mammals, 315 species of amphibians and 341
          reptiles. It is also home to the world’s largest rodent, the Capybara.
          Adult capybaras grow to 106 to 134cm (3.48 to 4.40 ft) in length.

        <h2>Tell me more!</h2>

        <p>
          An atmospheric phenomenon takes place here! Lake Maracaibo is a large
          tidal bay that was once the largest lake in South America and at 20–36
          million years old, is one of the oldest lakes on Earth. It is also the
          most active area for lightning strikes in the world. This weather
          phenomenon is known as the Catatumbo lightning and during powerful
          storms, there can be up to 28 strikes of lightning per minute.

        <h2>I heard about a waterfall, is that true?</h2>

        <p>
          Venezuela is home to Angel Falls, also called Salto Angel. The
          indigenous and official name is Kerepakupai merú which means waterfall
          of the deepest place. With a height of 979 metres (3,211 ft) and a
          drop of 807 metres (2,648 ft), this is the highest or tallest
          uninterrupted waterfall in the world. The Angel Falls plunges over the
          edge of the Auyán-tepui mountain, which is located in the Canaima
          National Park. This 30,000 km2 (12,000 sq mi) UNESCO World Heritage
          site is the sixth biggest national park in the world. It is the same
          size as the country Belgium.
