          Muay Thai, which translates to “Thai Boxing”, is the national sport of
          Thailand. It is a martial art with roots originating from military use
          dating back to around the 13th century during the time of the
          Sukhothai Kingdom. Muay Thai is known as the “Art of 8 limbs” because
          it makes use of 8 points of contact namely, punches, elbows, knees and
          kicks. This differs it from other stand-up combat sports such as
          boxing (2 points - fists) and karate (4 points - fists and feet).
          Today, Muay Thai is practised and competed not only in Thailand, but
          also all around the world.

        <h2>What is Muay Thai or Thai Boxing?</h2>

        <p>
          “Muay” translates to mean “boxing” in Thai, so Muay Thai is literally
          Thai boxing. Taking elements from Muay Boran, the traditional Thai
          martial arts, Muay Thai as a modern combat sport was first formalized
          in the early 20th century. The sport was influenced by British boxing
          where codified rules and the boxing ring were put in place. During
          this period, fighters also ditched wrapping hands with ropes (“Kard
          Chuek”) and began wearing boxing gloves in competitions. Muay Thai is
          a stand-up striking sport, with two competitors in the ring throwing
          punches, elbows, knees and kicks at each other. Clinching, sweeps and
          throws are also allowed. Besides the 8-point contact, a key difference
          between Muay Thai and many other stand-up combat sports is its
          emphasis on traditional elements such as the pre-fight dance ritual
          known as Wai Kru Ram Muay, the head dress (Mongkon) and the Sarama
          music that accompanies each fight. Read this ultimate guide to Muay
          Thai to find out everything you need to know about the sport.
