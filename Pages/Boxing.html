          Sport, both amateur and professional, involving attack and defense
          with the fists. Boxers usually wear padded gloves and generally
          observe the code set forth in the marquess of Queensberry rules.
          Matched in weight and ability, boxing contestants try to land blows
          hard and often with their fists, each attempting to avoid the blows of
          the opponent. A boxer wins a match either by outscoring the
          opponent—points can be tallied in several ways—or by rendering the
          opponent incapable of continuing the match. Bouts range from 3 to 12
          rounds, each round normally lasting three minutes.

          Mike Tyson's professional debut was as an 18 year old boxer in 1985.
          His first 19 professional bouts all resulted in wins, with 12 of them
          being decided in the first round. He went on to win 26 of his first 28
          professional bouts by knockout or technical knockout, with 16 of those
          being in the fight's initial round. Tyson's first title bout was for
          the WBC Championship in 1986. His opponent was Trevor Berbick, whom he
          easily knocked out in the second round. He added the WBA belt with a
          unanimous decision over James Smith in 1987 and added to the
          collection by defeating IBF champ Tony Tucker by another unanimous
          conclusion. Due to these title fights and his success, Tyson was named
          Ring Magazine's Fighter of the Year and both 1986 and 1988.
